Join Overview
A joins is an SQL operation performed to establish a connecion between two or more database
table based on the matching or common field between them.

1. Create sample tanles
2. Types of joins
3. Condition ON, USING, and NATURAL
4. Outer joins and the order of evalutation.


Create sample Tables
This sectiom provides the process of creating the sample tables
that later sections use to describe join features.

1st  Table
Step		Action
1. CREATE		CREATE TABLE cows_one (cnumber int, cbreed varchar(20));
2. Insert		INSERT INTO cows_one (1,'Holstein');
3. SELECT		SELECT * FROM cows_one;


2nd TABLE
Step 		Action
1. CREATE 	CREATE TABLE cows_two (cnumber int, breeds varchar(20));
2. Insert 		INSERT INTO cows_two(2, 'jersey');
3. SELECT		SELECT *FROM cows_two;

Conditions ON, USING, and NATURAL
you can use the join conditions ON, USING and Natural to specify join criteria.
-The ON clause is the most flexible. It can handle all join criteria, and, in certain cases, non-join criteria.
-The USING and NATURAL clauses provides convenient ways to specify joins when the join columns have 
the same name.


Cross Join
You cannot use an ON. USING or NATURAL condition with a cross join.
(Returns all possinle combination of rows from two tables.)


Inner Join
(Using a comparison operator to match rows from two tables that are based on the values in common columns
from each table.)
-ON join_condition
select * from cows_one INNER JOIN cows_two ON cows_one.cnumber=cows_two.cnunumber;

-USING join_cloumn_list
Select * from cows-One INNER JOIN cows_two USING (cnumber);

-NATURAL
select * from cows_on NATURAL INNER JOIN cows_two;


LEFT JOIN
(Return all the rows from the left table that are specified in the left outer join cluase, not 
just the rows in which the columns match.)

RIGHT OUTER JOIN
(Returns all the rows from the right table that are specified in the right outer join clause, not just the 
rows in which the columns match.)

FULL OUTER JOIN
(Returns all the rows in both the left and right tables.)
-ON join_condition
select * FROM cows_one FULL OUTER JOIN cows_two ON cows_one.cnumber=cows_two.cnumber;

-USING join_cloumn_list
select * from cows_one FULL OUTER JOIN cows_two using (cnumber);

-NATURAL
select * from cows_one NATURAL FULL JOIN cows_two;
